# INST327-Database
This repository contains a sample database and a set of queries based on electric vehicle registration data from the Washington State Department of Licensing. The database includes both battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), covering a wide range of makes, models, and technical details.

Our goal with this project was to make it easier for users—especially those interested in learning more about electric vehicles or considering purchasing one—to explore the different options available. The database highlights how electric vehicles have developed over the years, providing comparisons between older and newer models and showing how different makes perform across various areas of Washington.

Inside this repository, you’ll find:

A sample dataset populated with real-world electric vehicle registration data

SQL queries designed to help users filter, compare, and analyze different electric vehicle options based on their needs

Example queries to compare technical specifications, registration trends, and model evolution over time

This project is intended for anyone interested in electric vehicles, vehicle data analysis, or simply exploring how technology in the automotive world is progressing.
